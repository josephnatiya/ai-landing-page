# Reflection: AI-Enhanced Landing Page Project

**Which AI tool(s) did you use?**  
I used **ChatGPT** to generate parts of the HTML and CSS code for my landing page. Specifically, ChatGPT helped build the "Services Section" HTML and the "Hero Section" CSS styling.

**How did it help you?**  
ChatGPT saved time by offering fast, clean, and customizable code snippets. It also helped me stay focused on design decisions instead of starting everything from scratch.

**What challenges did you encounter?**  
It was sometimes difficult to understand how to integrate AI-generated code with my existing styles. I had to adjust class names and styles to keep everything consistent and responsive.

**What did you learn overall about using AI for coding?**  
I learned that AI is a powerful assistant that can boost productivity and creativity. However, reviewing and editing the code is essential to ensure that it fits project-specific goals and doesnâ€™t break functionality.
