# Reflection: AI-Enhanced Landing Page Project

**Which AI tool(s) did you use?**  
I used **ChatGPT** to generate parts of the HTML and CSS code for my landing page.

**How did it help you?**  
ChatGPT empowered developers by providing selection of numerous efficient, clean and easily editable codes. It also helped me not to reinvent things whenever I wanted to work on different sections of the project while keeping me on track in terms of design choices.

**What challenges did you encounter?**  
Making it possible to work with code generated by AI for me has been quite challenging at some point to explain how it fits well within my working style. This entailed shifting between class names and styles to ensure that classes followed a certain pattern, and all the elements are scalable.

**What did you learn overall about using AI for coding?**  
I found out that artificial intelligence is an academic amalgam that enhances efficiency and innovation. However, it remains necessary upon the code to review it in order to align it with the products of certain projects, and not to worsen the existing essential functions.
